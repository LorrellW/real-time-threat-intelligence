Overview

This platform enables cybersecurity teams to detect, assess, and respond to threats using integrated OSINT feeds, 
AI-driven analysis, and automated defense mechanisms. It combines proactive blue teaming, behavioral anomaly detection, 
and intelligent response into a centralized intelligence dashboard.

System Architecture

Database: PostgreSQL stores all threat, asset, and log data.
Backend Services:
anomaly_detector.py: Behavioral analysis and alerting
threat_correlation_engine.py: Cross-system threat grouping
remediation_engine.py: Auto-response to critical risks
API Layer: REST endpoints for interacting with data
Frontend (Remix): Web dashboard for managing assets and visualizing risks

User Roles & Access Control

Admin - Full permissions
Analyst - View dashboards, run reports, invetigate alerts
Automation - background access for scripts and AI components

Using the Platform

4.1 Asset Management
Assets represent systems, users, or data points in the environment
Add/edit assets via the dashboard or /api/assets endpoints
4.2 Threat Detection
OSINT tools (Shodan, HIBP, VirusTotal) feed into the threats table
each threat has a risk score based on likelihood x impact
4.3 Automated Risk Scoring
GPT-4 models can re-evaluate threats based on updated context
scores are automatically updated threats.risk_score
4.4 Behavior Monitoring
behavior_logs track events (logins, file access, etc.)
the anomaly engine flags unusual patterns and logs them in event_log and threats
4.5 Correlation Engine
related threats (same asset, close timing, similar names) are grouped by threat_correlation_engine.py
Groups are stored in threat_events
4.6 Automated Remediation
high-risk threats (risk level > 8) trigger the remediation engine
actions include: 
  Quarentine (simulated)
  Token revocation
  SOC notifications
results are logged in remediation_actions

Monitoring & Response
all alerts and threat events can be viewed via the dashboard or queried via /api/threats and /api/event_log
use /api/alerts for external integration or alert ingestion

Maintenance & Updates
Regularly pull OSINT updates via scheduled jobs
Periodically run detection engines (anomaly, correlation, remediation)
backup PostgreSQL database weekly

Security & Data Integrity
Access controlled via roles and tokens
logs are immutable once written
schema constraints prevent invalid risk scoring

Troubleshooting
Issue:                        Fix:
no anomalies being flagged -- ensure behavior_logs is populated with diverse events
No automated remediation occuring -- check thresholds and remediation success flags
threats not correlated -- verify threat timestamps and names for similarity
api errors -- inspect remix route logs and backend connectivity
