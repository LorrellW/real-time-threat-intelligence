Technology Stack Selection

For the real-time threat intelligence system, I've chosen the following technology stack:

- Back-End -
Framework: Flask (Python)
Rationale: Lightweight, easy to integrate with various APIs, and well-suited for rapid development.

- Front-End -
Framework: React
Rationale: Robust UI library that enables the creation of a responsive, real-time dashboard.
Database:

Option: PostgreSQL
Rationale: Relational database offering strong consistency and support for complex queries. (Alternatively, MongoDB can be considered for flexibility with unstructured data.)
OSINT API Integrations:

Tools: Shodan, Have I Been Pwned, VirusTotal
Rationale: These services offer reliable API access for detecting exposed services, checking for breached credentials, and assessing malware/domain reputation.
LLM Model for Risk Scoring:

Option: OpenAI GPT-4 API
Rationale: Provides advanced language understanding for analyzing threat data and supporting risk evaluation.
