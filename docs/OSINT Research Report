OSINT Research Report

Shodan:
Purpose: Detects exposed services and devices on the internet.
Integration: Utilize the Shodan API to periodically scan IP addresses and aggregate exposure data.
API Access: RESTful API; authentication via API key.

Have I Been Pwned:
Purpose: Checks for breached credentials and data exposures.
Integration: Use the API to cross-reference email addresses and domains against known breaches.
API Access: RESTful API; rate limits apply.

VirusTotal:
Purpose: Provides malware and domain reputation analysis.
Integration: Implement API calls to fetch scan reports for files, URLs, and domains in real time.
API Access: REST API with public and premium endpoints.

SecurityTrails:
Purpose: Offers domain and IP intelligence.
Integration: Use API to gather DNS records, historical data, and other relevant domain information.
API Access: API key required; detailed documentation available.

theHarvester:
Purpose: Collects emails, subdomains, hosts, and open ports.
Integration: Though primarily a command-line tool, results can be parsed and imported into our system via scripts.
API Access: Local execution with output integration.

IntelOwl:
Purpose: Aggregates threat intelligence data from multiple sources.
Integration: Deploy as an internal aggregator with API endpoints that feed into our dashboard.
API Access: RESTful API; customizable for internal use.

Recon-ng & Maltego:
Purpose: Offer web reconnaissance and graphical link analysis respectively.
Integration: Use as supplementary tools for in-depth investigations, with data feeds manually reviewed before integration.
API Access: Varies; some features via API or custom scripts.

Censys:
Purpose: Conducts internet-wide scan data analysis.
Integration: Leverage the Censys API to gather certificate, host, and network infrastructure data.
API Access: Requires registration and API key.

Hunter.io:
Purpose: Finds email addresses and contact details across domains.
Integration: Integrate API calls to verify and enrich contact data for threat actor profiling.
API Access: REST API; usage based on quota.

ANY.RUN:
Purpose: Provides interactive malware analysis.
Integration: Utilize API to retrieve analysis reports and incorporate indicators of compromise (IOCs) into the system.
API Access: API available for automated retrieval of analysis data.

Integration Strategy:

API Management: All selected tools offer RESTful APIs (or command-line interfaces that can be scripted) that allow for seamless integration.
Data Aggregation: Data fetched from these tools will be normalized and stored in our database to support real-time analysis and risk scoring.
Dashboard Integration: The front-end (React) will present aggregated OSINT data in a user-friendly dashboard, enabling actionable insights.
Rate Limiting & Authentication: Each APIâ€™s authentication methods (e.g., API keys) and rate limits will be managed through our back-end (Flask) to ensure robust and reliable data retrieval.
