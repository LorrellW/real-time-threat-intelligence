Walkthrough Guide:
Step 1 — Access the Platform
The system runs as a backend-first cybersecurity intelligence and remediation platform.

Connect to the PostgreSQL database using psql or a web interface (such as pgAdmin) to view and manage assets, threats, and TVA mappings.

Front-end dashboard may also connect to the same database for viewing threats and metrics.

Step 2 — Registering and Managing Assets
Assets represent critical systems, servers, endpoints, applications, or databases in the organization.

Use the assets table to add new assets:

Step 3 — Performing OSINT Scans and Gathering Threat Intelligence
The platform uses integrated OSINT scripts to gather up-to-date public exposure data.

the osint_scanner.py function performs lookups via Shodan, Have I been Pwned, and VirusTotal, then inserts the threats into a table

Step 4 — Reviewing Threats and Prioritization
The risk score is computed dynamically based on likelihood, impact, and AI assessments.

Step 5 — AI Risk Analysis (Dynamic Risk Prioritization)
AI-enhanced risk analysis uses GPT to:

Recalculate likelihood and impact values based on context.

Automatically update the tva_mapping risk scores to reflect urgency.

New risk scores are calculated and threat priorities are updated accordingly.

Step 6 — Automated Remediation (Responding to Critical Threats)
Once threats are assessed, the platform can simulate or trigger automated responses.

The system will:

Identify critical/high-risk threats.

Apply simulated remediation actions such as asset quarantine, IP blocklisting, token revocation, or SOC notification.

Log actions into event_log for tracking.

Step 7 — Generating Threat Reports
running generate_report.py will:

A summary of all assets and associated threats.

Top critical threats and risk scores.

Remediation actions taken.

Recommendations for next steps.

A markdown file threat_report.md will be generated.

Step 8 — Auditing and Event Logs
Use event_log to review all security actions:

This table is useful for forensic analysis, audits, and compliance reviews.
